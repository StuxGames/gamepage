# Game Page

The placeholder for a Stux.Games game whose page hasn't been set up yet.

## Overview

It's shown in place of a Stux.Games game's page until that page is built. The main card is a handheld console whose screen reads GAME PAGE NOT FOUND, with a D-pad and A/B buttons, a Visit Stux.Games link and a way to ask about the game.

It's a static site on GitHub Pages at [gamepage.stux.games](https://gamepage.stux.games): no framework, no build step and no backend. It comes with the Boring Legal Stuff pages (`/legal`), a changelog page (`/changelog`), a sitemap (`/sitemap/`, `sitemap.xml`) and a themed 404 page, in light and dark themes.

## Features

- 🎮 Stux.Games' gold pair (`#FFBA1A` on dark, `#855D00` on light) on a pixel-dot grid with faint CRT scanlines
- 🌗 Light and dark themes: follows the system, with a toggle that remembers the choice
- 🔤 Oxanium, self-hosted under `assets/fonts/` (SIL Open Font License)
- 📱 Responsive, and animations stop for visitors who prefer reduced motion
- ⚖️ Privacy Policy, Terms and Ethics, Cookies Policy, Imprint, Disclaimer and Opt-Out Preferences

## Local development

```bash
./dev-server.sh            # http://127.0.0.1:8000, DEV_MODE on (dev banner)
./dev-server.sh 8080       # another port
./dev-server.sh --no-dev-mode   # exactly as production renders
```

On Windows use `dev-server.bat` with the same arguments. The server is PHP 7.4's built-in
server with `.github/dev-router.php`, which serves the folder the way GitHub Pages does.
With DEV_MODE on, `?banner=soon,maintenance,site` previews the other banner types.

## Releasing

Update `CHANGELOG.md`, bump `VERSION.md`, then run `./commit.sh "Release message"` (or
`commit.bat`), which commits and tags `vYY.MM.DD` from `VERSION.md`. Pushing to `main` deploys
through `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

## Versioning

This project uses [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing): each release is numbered by its UTC release date as `YY.MM.DD` (for example `26.10.23`), with `-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same day. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each release.
